                <p class="p-jh">I've always liked guitars and have been into playing for a while. Recently, I bought a new electric guitar which is a replica of Jimi Hendrix's guitar!</p>
                <p class="p-jh">This is what my guitar looks like.</p>
                <p>I first started playing when I was younger but due to moving and my short attention span, I dropped learning it. However, after years, I want to try again.</p>
                <p>Being in a new environment, I realized I need something to ground myself and not stress so much about work. I feel learning guitar can be a healthy outlet for stress and creativity that everyone should at least try if they're interested.</p>
