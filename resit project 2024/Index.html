        <h2>Tips on guitars? We got you</h2>
        <p>When first purchasing a guitar, you should research what type of music you'd like to play!</p>
		
        <h3">Types of guitars?</h3>
        <p>There are three main types of guitars: the acoustic guitar, which uses its hollow body to produce the deep sound we hear; the electric guitar, which uses six magnets to pick up the vibrations, allowing you to play in several different types of tones; and the bass guitar, which creates a deep, supporting sound to complement the rest of the instruments being played.</p>

            <p>
                This is a photo of my new guitar! When buying a guitar second-hand, make sure there aren't any cracks on the body. Another thing to look out for is old, used strings; it's always best to replace the old ones if they seem worn, and always have a spare just in case, especially when you're just starting to learn!
            </p>

			In the gallery are useful cords that you should learn if youre starting of. Personally i think learning a song you already like will give you the motivation to keep learning so the best thing you can do is figure out which cords your song uses and practice hem until you can connect them into one melody.
